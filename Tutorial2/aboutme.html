								<p>​My name is Kiara le Gras and I am currently a preservice teacher studying a Bachelor of Teaching (Secondary) and a Bachelor of Technology (Arts) at Australian Catholic University (ACU). I am pursuing a career as a industrial technology and design and technology teacher, becoming a teacher has always been very intriguing to me, my mother was a primary school teacher and I grew up going to school with her when i had days off and always loved it.  
									​Teachers from high school were always another drive for me to become a teacher, I often spoke with them about my interest and they helped drive me to becoming a teacher. They allowed for me to see different styles of teaching and how to connect with students.  </p>

								<p>Always knowing that I wanted to be a teacher I started to look at different options for teaching and that is when I discovered technology and applied studies teaching. I've always had a love for hands on subjects as i believe that is how i learn best, i looked further into it and decided that this was what i wanted to do.  
									I chose design and technology as on of my senior subjects for year 11 and 12. when I started year 11, I couldn't seem to pass any of my assessments and I couldn't understand why. I eventually got a tutor and we spend 2 hours every week going through the basics and why the information is necessary in a portfolio. Once I started with her I began to understand how it all works and my marks started to incline.
									I'm excited to discover new avenues in technology and learn about new technologies and their capabilities. Some of my future goals include branching out after graduation to become qualified in other subjects in order for me to become a better teacher with more knowledge. My main goal throughout my career is to show students that school is not all about traditional classes, that it can be fun and engaging. This will give students an outlet to be in a more collaborative and creative environment. </p>
